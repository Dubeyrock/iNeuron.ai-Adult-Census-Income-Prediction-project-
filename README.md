# Salary-Predicition-Web-App-Machine-Learning-
Productionized Machine Learning Model for Salary Prediction

#### In this project we built a fully productionized machine learning web application for salary prediction based on various parameters.

#### Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.

A demom version of this app can be seen in Youtube in this link: https://youtu.be/EcPSI7BSuKg. Kindly watch this video to get an idea of the app.

Dataset has been loaded in the data folder. The raw version of the data can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/. 

We have used three machine learning models for the prediction aspects. 

The web framework used for the project is Streamlit.

Dependencies:

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* joblib
* streamlit
* eli5
